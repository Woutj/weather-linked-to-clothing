# Linking clothing to weather

## About the project
This code is made for a schoolproject. The main function of the code is to find out what clothes are appropriate to wear.
This project contains 4 files, a HTML file, a CSS file and two JavaScript files. 
The JavaScript files mainly have the same function but are split so they don't have influence on each other.


## Getting started


### Prerequisites
To edit the code you'll need a code editor. 

- Recommendations

Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
  I recommend Visual Studio Code. It's an easy to use system with lots of expansions.
  
Sublime Text https://www.sublimetext.com/
  Another easy to use code editor. It has less expansions but is easy to get stated with.

#### API-key
For this project you'll need to add an API-key. This code is based around the Open weather map API.
To use the code simply paste the key in BOTH the search.js file and in the scripts.js.

### Running the code

To run the code you just need to add the files to a folder and open the index.html file.
If you run the code with a browser you'll see the home screen, here you can either search for a city, or use the location button to find out what the weather is like on your location. 

## Usage

The code is pretty simple, the upper half is used to get the information from the API, the lower half is a bunch of if statements which print out the different weather types.
For a more detailed explanation what the different parts of the code do I've added comments to the JavaSript files. .
